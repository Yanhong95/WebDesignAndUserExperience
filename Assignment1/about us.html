	<h2>As a Barista:</h2>
	<ul>
  <li>Attention to Detail</li>
  <p>Many coffee shop customers make very specific drink requests. It is up to the barista to accurately measure and mix all of the ingredients, and create the drink the customer wants. This requires a high attention to detail, as well as some general measuring and math skills. You will also need this attention to detail when working the cash register.</p>
  <li>Customer Service</li>
    <p>As a barista, you will be dealing directly with customers all day. This requires strong interpersonal skills. You have to be able to put on a friendly face when interacting with customers. You need to listen carefully to their orders, and be able to answer any questions they have. This requires strong communication skills as well.</p>
  <li>Responsibility</li>
    <p>Hiring managers want to know their baristas will show up to work on time and be professional, responsible employees. You can demonstrate this skill in your interview simply by showing up a few minutes early, dressing in clean and appropriate attire, and bringing all requested documents.</p>
  <li>Technical Skills</li>
  <p>Some coffee shops will hire baristas who have no experience making coffee and other beverages. However, many companies expect you to have some experience. Read the job listing carefully â€“ if you need any technical skills, be prepared to provide evidence of your knowledge. For example, during the interview, the hiring manager might even ask you to make a drink on the spot!</p>
